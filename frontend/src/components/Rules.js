You can respond afterwards and choose the afternoon, late or MNF game if possible. If some reason I mistakenly allow a duplicate pick and no flex picks are available, the pick is removed and an alphabetical pick occurs and awarded 0 points. (Recommendation: this is not a good strategy to try and schedule around, this will only hurt you in the long run)
